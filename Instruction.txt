This program is designed for analyizing the move ment of fish's fins.

main.cpp is the main progress, which offers a platform to use and control the operating functions. This file was written based on an old test file, so many of the lines are not necessary.

SuperContour.cpp is the kernel file, which defines a class including critical parameters, data and structures and methods.
This file also defines the methods in this class, which mainly include seceral types:

---1. Basic operating functions.
	This cluster of functions mainly define the data structure and operation of the class 'SuperContour', they also give the method to write and read the class.
	
---2. Basic Contour-feature functions.
	This cluster of functions mainly calculate the feature of the contour, e.g. curvature, center, central-axis, etc.

---3. Functions for template-matching and fin-tracking
	This cluster of functions often use the functions above and calculate the fish's position, direction, parameters which can be used to match to the original templates.
	
	Another major task of this cluster of functions is to recognize the fin of a fish.
